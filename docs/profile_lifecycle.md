# Profile Lifecycle

## Overview

Every LinkedIn profile flows through a fixed sequence of stages, from first
discovery on a page to agentic follow-up conversations.

```
Discovery → Enrichment + Embedding → Qualification (LLM) → QUALIFIED → READY_TO_CONNECT (GP gate) → PENDING → CONNECTED → COMPLETED
  (url)       (voyager + fastembed)     (always LLM)         (Deal)     (GP prob > threshold)         (sent)    (accepted)   (agent follow-up)
```

---

## 1. Discovery

**Where:** `browser/nav.py` — `goto_page()` → `_extract_in_urls()` → `_discover_and_enrich()`

Every time the daemon navigates to a LinkedIn page (search results, profile
pages, feed), all `/in/` URLs on the page are extracted. New URLs (those
without an existing Lead) are immediately processed.

LLM-generated search keywords (`pipeline/search.py:run_search()`) drive
additional discovery when the candidate pool runs dry.

## 2. Enrichment + Embedding (eager, at discovery time)

**Where:** `browser/nav.py:_discover_and_enrich()` → `db/leads.py:create_enriched_lead()` → `ml/embeddings.py:embed_profile()`

For each new URL discovered:

1. **Voyager API** fetches structured profile data (name, headline, positions, education, etc.)
2. **Lead** is created with the full profile JSON in `description`
3. **Company** is created/linked from the first position
4. **ProfileEmbedding** is computed (384-dim BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 via fastembed) and stored with `label=null`

All three steps happen atomically at discovery time. Rate-limited by
`enrich_min_interval` (default 1s per profile).

> **Robustness fallback:** Lazy helpers (`ensure_lead_enriched`,
> `ensure_profile_embedded`) exist in `db/enrichment.py` for rare edge
> cases (manual lead creation, interrupted enrichment, DB inconsistency).
> They log a warning when triggered — this is not normal flow.

## 3. Qualification (LLM only)

**Where:** `pipeline/qualify.py:run_qualification()` (called from connect task backfill via `pools.py`)

Unlabeled `ProfileEmbedding` rows are the qualification pool. Candidate
selection depends on label balance:

| Condition | Strategy | Method |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `n_negatives > n_positives` | **Exploit** — pick highest predicted probability | `qualifier.predict_probs()` |
| Otherwise | **Explore** — pick highest BALD score | `qualifier.compute_bald()` |

All qualification decisions go through the LLM via `qualify_lead.j2` prompt.
The GP model is used only for candidate selection strategy, not for auto-decisions.

### Cold start

With fewer than 2 labels or a single class, the GP model returns `None`.
The first candidate is selected in order and qualified via LLM.

### Result

- `ProfileEmbedding.label` set to 0 or 1, with `llm_reason` and `labeled_at`
- Accepted: Lead promoted → Contact + Company + Deal (stage=QUALIFIED)
- Rejected: FAILED Deal with "Disqualified" closing reason (campaign-scoped, not `Lead.disqualified`)

## 4. Ready to Connect (QUALIFIED → READY_TO_CONNECT)

**Where:** `pipeline/ready_pool.py:promote_to_ready()`

After qualification, profiles sit at the QUALIFIED stage. Before connecting, they
must pass a GP confidence gate:

- `promote_to_ready()` loads all QUALIFIED profiles, computes P(f > 0.5) via the GP model
- Profiles with probability above `min_ready_to_connect_prob` (default 0.9) are promoted to READY_TO_CONNECT
- During cold start (GP not fitted), no profiles are promoted — the connect task keeps triggering qualifications until enough labels accumulate

## 5. Connect (READY_TO_CONNECT → PENDING)

**Where:** `tasks/connect.py:handle_connect()`

The connect handler picks the top READY_TO_CONNECT profile from the pool
(`pipeline/pools.py:find_candidate()` → `pipeline/ready_pool.py:find_ready_candidate()`).

If the pool is empty, the **backfill chain** runs via composable generators:
1. `ready_source()` — check if any QUALIFIED profiles pass the GP gate via `promote_to_ready()`
2. `qualify_source()` — qualify the next unlabeled profile via `run_qualification()`
3. `search_source()` — discover new profiles via `run_search()`

Each generator pulls from the next when empty. Each `qualify_source` iteration
produces exactly one label, preventing infinite-search-without-qualifying.

Connection request is sent without a note. Deal moves to PENDING stage.
Rate-limited by `LinkedInProfile.can_execute()` / `record_action()`.

**Unreachable profile detection**: when `send_connection_request` returns
QUALIFIED (no Connect button), `connect_attempts` is incremented; after
`MAX_CONNECT_ATTEMPTS` (3), the lead is disqualified (`lead.disqualified=True`)
and the Deal is marked FAILED.

## 6. Check Pending (PENDING → CONNECTED)

**Where:** `tasks/check_pending.py:handle_check_pending()`

Checks **one** PENDING profile per task execution via `get_connection_status()`.
Uses **exponential backoff** with multiplicative jitter per profile:

- Initial interval: `check_pending_recheck_after_hours` (default 24h)
- Doubles each time the profile is still pending
- Stored in `deal.next_step` as `{"backoff_hours": N}`

On acceptance → enqueues `follow_up` task.

## 7. Follow Up (CONNECTED → COMPLETED)

**Where:** `tasks/follow_up.py:handle_follow_up()` → `agents/follow_up.py:run_follow_up_agent()`

Runs an **agentic multi-turn conversation** for one CONNECTED profile:

1. The ReAct agent reads conversation history with the lead
2. Sends one or more short messages (human-like LinkedIn DMs)
3. Can mark the conversation as completed or schedule the next follow-up
4. System prompt from `follow_up_agent.j2` with campaign context and lead profile data

Records `FOLLOW_UP` action if any message was sent. Safety net re-enqueues
in 72h if the agent didn't schedule or complete.

## 8. Terminal States

- **COMPLETED** — conversation completed by the agent (booked, declined, or went cold)
- **FAILED** — unrecoverable error at any stage, or LLM rejection (campaign-scoped "Disqualified" closing reason)

## Freemium Campaigns

Freemium campaigns skip qualification, READY_TO_CONNECT, and search entirely.
They query `ProfileEmbedding` for any embedded lead without a Deal in their
department (excluding permanently disqualified leads), ranked by `KitQualifier`.
Profiles go straight to connect, with delay scaled by `action_fraction` to
maintain a target ratio of freemium vs regular connections.
