# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Documentation Rule

When modifying code, always update CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md to reflect the changes. This includes changes to models, function signatures, module structure, configuration keys, state machines, lane behavior, ML pipeline, and any other architectural details documented in these files. Documentation must stay in sync with the code at all times.

## Commit Rule

Do not add `Co-Authored-By` lines to commit messages. Commit messages must be a single line (no body or multi-line descriptions).

## Dependency Rule

Dependencies are managed in `requirements/*.txt` files. `requirements/` files are used by both local dev and Docker.

## Project Overview

OpenOutreach is a self-hosted LinkedIn automation tool for B2B lead generation. It uses Playwright with stealth plugins for browser automation and LinkedIn's internal Voyager API for structured profile data. The CRM backend is powered by DjangoCRM with Django Admin UI.

## Architecture

### Entry Flow
`manage.py` (Django bootstrap + auto-migrate + CRM setup):
- Suppresses Pydantic serialization warning from langchain-openai. Configures logging: DEBUG level, suppresses noisy third-party loggers (urllib3, httpx, langchain, openai, playwright, httpcore, fastembed, huggingface_hub, filelock).
- No args → runs the daemon: `ensure_onboarding()` → validate `LLM_API_KEY` → get session (sets default campaign: first non-partner or first available) → `ensure_browser()` → `ensure_self_profile()` (creates disqualified Lead + `/in/me/` sentinel via Voyager API) → GDPR newsletter override (guarded by marker file `.{handle}_newsletter_processed`) → `run_daemon(session)` which initializes the `BayesianQualifier` (GPR pipeline, warm-started from historical labels) and spreads actions at a configurable pace across multiple campaigns. New profiles are auto-discovered as the daemon navigates LinkedIn pages. When all lanes are idle, LLM-generated search keywords discover new profiles.
- Any args → delegates to Django's `execute_from_command_line` (e.g. `runserver`, `migrate`, `createsuperuser`).

### Onboarding (`onboarding.py`)
Before the daemon starts, `ensure_onboarding()` ensures a Campaign, active LinkedInProfile, LLM config, and legal acceptance exist. Four checks:

1. **Campaign** — if no `Campaign` exists in DB, runs interactive prompts for campaign name, product docs, campaign objective, booking link. Creates `Department` + `Campaign` (followup template seeded from `followup2.j2`).
2. **LinkedInProfile** — if no active profile exists, prompts for LinkedIn email, password, newsletter preference, and rate limits. Creates `User` + `LinkedInProfile`. Handle derived from email slug (part before `@`, lowercased, dots/plus → underscores). User created with `is_staff=True` and unusable password.
3. **LLM config** — if missing from `.env`, prompts user for `LLM_API_KEY` (required), `AI_MODEL` (required), and `LLM_API_BASE` (optional), and writes them to `.env`.
4. **Legal notice** — `_require_legal_acceptance()` displays GitHub URL to `LEGAL_NOTICE.md`, prompts for acceptance (y/n). Guarded by marker file at `COOKIES_DIR/.legal_notice_accepted` — only runs once.

### Profile State Machine
The `navigation/enums.py:ProfileState` is a `models.TextChoices` enum whose values ARE the CRM stage names: `QUALIFIED` ("Qualified"), `READY_TO_CONNECT` ("Ready to Connect"), `PENDING` ("Pending"), `CONNECTED` ("Connected"), `COMPLETED` ("Completed"), `FAILED` ("Failed"). Pre-Deal states are implicit: a Lead with no description is "url_only" (discovered), a Lead with description is "enriched", a Lead with `disqualified=True` is disqualified. Promotion from Lead to Contact+Deal happens when qualification passes.

`_get_stage()` uses `state.value` directly to look up Stage objects — no mapping dict needed.

The daemon (`daemon.py`) runs continuously with multi-campaign support. Each campaign gets its own `LaneSchedule` objects for three **scheduled lanes** that fire at a fixed pace set by `min_action_interval` (default 120s, ±20% random jitter). Daily/weekly rate limiters independently cap totals (shared across campaigns). Partner campaigns use probabilistic gating via `Campaign.action_fraction`. Regular campaigns are inversely gated: when a partner campaign exists, regular actions are skipped with probability = `action_fraction` (so at 1.0, only partner campaigns run).

1. **Connect** (scheduled, lazy chain) — Pull-based architecture. `execute()` calls `get_candidate()` from `pools.py` which checks the READY_TO_CONNECT pool via `ready_pool.py`. If no candidate, runs `promote_to_ready()` (GP confidence gate on QUALIFIED profiles), then `qualify_one()` and `search_one()` to backfill. After backfilling, re-checks the pool. If a candidate is found, connects → PENDING. Partner campaigns bypass READY_TO_CONNECT and pick directly from QUALIFIED pool.
2. **Check Pending** (scheduled) — checks PENDING profiles for acceptance → CONNECTED. Uses exponential backoff per profile: initial interval = `check_pending_recheck_after_hours` (default 24h), doubles each time a profile is still pending.
3. **Follow Up** (scheduled) — sends follow-up message to CONNECTED profiles → COMPLETED. Contacts profiles immediately once discovered as connected. Interval = `min_action_interval`.

### Qualification ML Pipeline

The qualification lane uses a **Gaussian Process Regressor** (sklearn, ConstantKernel * RBF) inside a `Pipeline(PCA, StandardScaler, GPR)` with BALD active learning:

1. **Balance-driven selection** — Which profile to evaluate next depends on label balance:
   - If `n_negatives > n_positives` → **exploit**: pick highest predicted probability (`predicted_probs()`)
   - Otherwise → **explore**: pick highest BALD score (`bald_scores()`, MC sampling from GP posterior)

2. **LLM decision** — All qualification decisions go through the LLM via `qualify_lead.j2` prompt. The GP model is used only for candidate selection strategy and the READY_TO_CONNECT confidence gate, not for auto-decisions.

3. **READY_TO_CONNECT gate** — After LLM qualifies a profile to QUALIFIED, it must also pass a GP confidence gate before becoming connectable. `promote_to_ready()` computes P(f > 0.5) for all QUALIFIED profiles; those above `min_ready_to_connect_prob` (default 0.9) are promoted to READY_TO_CONNECT. During cold start (GP not fitted), no profiles reach READY_TO_CONNECT — the connect lane keeps triggering qualifications until the model can fit.

The pipeline uses PCA (dimension selected via LML cross-validation over candidates `{2,4,6,10,15,20}`, capped at `min(n-1, 384)`) + StandardScaler + GPR on 384-dim FastEmbed embeddings. GPR kernel: `ConstantKernel(1.0) * RBF(length_scale=sqrt(n_pca))` with `alpha=0.1` and `n_restarts_optimizer=3`. Training data is accumulated incrementally; the model is lazily re-fitted (on ALL data, O(n³)) whenever predictions are requested after new labels arrive. Each non-partner campaign has its own model file at `assets/models/campaign_{id}_model.joblib` (via `model_path_for_campaign()`), persisted via `joblib` (atomic write via tmp+rename). On daemon restart, `warm_start()` bulk-loads historical labels and fits once. A legacy migration renames the old global `model.joblib` to the per-campaign path when exactly one non-partner campaign exists.

Cold start (< 2 labels or single class) returns `None` from `predict`/`bald_scores`/`predict_probs`, and `promote_to_ready()` returns 0. The connect lane keeps triggering `qualify_one()` to accumulate labels until the GP model can fit.

### CRM Data Model
- **Campaign** (`linkedin.models.Campaign`) — 1:1 with `common.Department`. Stores `product_docs`, `campaign_objective`, `followup_template` (Jinja2 prompt content), `booking_link`, `is_partner` (bool), `action_fraction` (float, probabilistic gating for partner campaigns).
- **LinkedInProfile** (`linkedin.models.LinkedInProfile`) — 1:1 with `auth.User`. Stores `linkedin_username`, `linkedin_password`, `subscribe_newsletter`, `active`, `connect_daily_limit`, `connect_weekly_limit`, `follow_up_daily_limit`. Rate-limiting methods: `can_execute(action_type)` checks daily/weekly limits via `ActionLog` counts, `record_action(action_type, campaign)` persists an action, `mark_exhausted(action_type)` flags external exhaustion for the day. Campaign membership is via Django group (User → Group → Department → Campaign).
- **SearchKeyword** (`linkedin.models.SearchKeyword`) — FK to Campaign. Stores `keyword`, `used` (bool), `used_at`. Unique together on `(campaign, keyword)`. Persists LLM-generated search keywords across restarts.
- **ActionLog** (`linkedin.models.ActionLog`) — FK to LinkedInProfile + Campaign. Stores `action_type` (choices: `connect`, `follow_up`), `created_at` (auto). Composite index on `(linkedin_profile, action_type, created_at)`. Used by `LinkedInProfile` rate-limit methods to count actions in the current day/week, surviving daemon restarts.
- **Lead** — Created per LinkedIn profile URL. Stores `first_name`, `last_name`, `title`, `website` (LinkedIn URL), `description` (full parsed profile JSON), `disqualified` (bool).
- **Contact** — Created after qualification (promotion from Lead), linked to Company.
- **Company** — Created from first position's company name.
- **Deal** — Tracks pipeline stage. One Deal per Contact. Stage maps to ProfileState. `next_step` field stores JSON metadata (e.g. `{"backoff_hours": N}` for exponential backoff in check_pending).
- **ProfileEmbedding** (`linkedin.models.ProfileEmbedding`) — Stores 384-dim fastembed vectors as `BinaryField` blobs in SQLite. `lead_id` (IntegerField PK), `public_identifier`, `embedding` (bytes), `label` (0/1 or null), `llm_reason`, `created_at`, `labeled_at`. Property `embedding_array` converts between bytes and numpy. Classmethod `get_labeled_arrays()` returns `(X, y)` numpy arrays for warm start. Lazy loading goes through `load_embedding()` in `crm_profiles.py`.
- **TheFile** — Raw Voyager API JSON attached to Lead via GenericForeignKey.

### Key Modules
- **`models.py`** — Django models: `Campaign` (1:1 with Department; product_docs, campaign_objective, followup_template, booking_link, is_partner, action_fraction), `LinkedInProfile` (1:1 with User; credentials, rate limits, newsletter preference; rate-limit methods `can_execute`/`record_action`/`mark_exhausted`), `SearchKeyword` (FK to Campaign; keyword, used, used_at), `ActionLog` (FK to LinkedInProfile + Campaign; action_type, created_at), and `ProfileEmbedding` (lead_id PK; embedding as BinaryField with `embedding_array` property for numpy conversion; `get_labeled_arrays()` classmethod; lazy loading via `load_embedding()` in `crm_profiles.py`). Registered in `admin.py`.
- **`daemon.py`** — Main daemon loop. `LaneSchedule` class tracks `next_run` per major lane; `reschedule()` adds ±20% jitter. `_PromoRotator` logs rotating promotional messages every N ticks. `_migrate_legacy_model(campaigns)` renames old global `model.joblib` to per-campaign path when exactly 1 non-partner campaign exists (warns otherwise). `_build_qualifiers(campaigns, cfg)` creates a `dict[int, BayesianQualifier]` keyed by campaign PK (one per non-partner campaign, each with `save_path=model_path_for_campaign(campaign.pk)`), warm-started from shared `get_labeled_data()`, plus a no-save-path partner qualifier; returns `(qualifiers, partner_qualifier)`. `run_daemon(session)` calls `_build_qualifiers()`, builds `LaneSchedule` objects per campaign for three scheduled lanes (connect, check_pending, follow_up). Qualification and search are embedded in the connect lane as a lazy chain (no gap-filling). All lane `.execute()` calls are wrapped with `failure_diagnostics(session)` — on unhandled exception, page HTML, screenshot, and traceback are saved to `assets/diagnostics/<timestamp>_<ErrorClass>/` before the error propagates. Rate limiting is handled by `LinkedInProfile` methods (DB-backed via `ActionLog`). Partner campaigns use probabilistic gating (`action_fraction`); regular campaigns inversely gated with probability = `max(partner.action_fraction)`. Also imports partner campaigns via `ml/hub.py`.
- **`diagnostics.py`** — Failure diagnostics capture. `capture_failure(session, error)` saves page HTML (`page.html`), screenshot (`screenshot.png`), and traceback (`error.txt`) into a per-failure folder under `assets/diagnostics/`. `failure_diagnostics(session)` is a context manager that calls `capture_failure` on unhandled exceptions, then re-raises.
- **`lanes/`** — Action lanes executed by the daemon:
  - `connect.py` — Thin connect lane. `execute()` calls `get_candidate()` from `pools.py`, then connects. Rate-limits via `session.linkedin_profile.can_execute()`/`record_action()`/`mark_exhausted()`. Accepts optional `pipeline` kwarg for partner campaigns (which skip qualification and search). Pre-existing connections always flow through as CONNECTED.
  - `check_pending.py` — Checks PENDING profiles for acceptance. Iterates ALL ready profiles per tick. Uses exponential backoff: doubles `backoff_hours` in `deal.next_step` each time a profile is still pending.
  - `follow_up.py` — Sends follow-up messages to CONNECTED profiles. Rate-limits via `session.linkedin_profile.can_execute()`/`record_action()`. Processes one profile per tick.
- **`pipeline/`** — Candidate sourcing, qualification, and pool management:
  - `qualify.py` — Qualify orchestration. `qualify_one(session, qualifier)` calls `_get_unlabeled_candidates(session)` for candidate sourcing, then selects via BALD/exploit strategy, always queries LLM for decisions. Private helpers: `_get_unlabeled_candidates()` (returns unlabeled ProfileEmbedding rows, embedding one new lead if none exist), `_record_decision()` (updates `ProfileEmbedding` label, promotes or disqualifies lead), `_get_profile_text()` (enriches + builds text).
  - `search.py` — Search keyword management. `search_one(session)` picks next unused keyword (generating fresh ones via LLM if exhausted), marks it used, runs LinkedIn People search via `search_people()`.
  - `ready_pool.py` — Ready-to-connect pool: GP confidence gate between QUALIFIED and READY_TO_CONNECT. `promote_to_ready(session, qualifier, threshold)` loads all QUALIFIED profiles, computes P(f > 0.5) via GP model, promotes those above threshold to READY_TO_CONNECT; returns 0 on cold start. `get_ready_candidate(session, qualifier, pipeline=None)` returns the top-ranked READY_TO_CONNECT profile or None.
  - `pools.py` — Pool management and backfill orchestration. `get_candidate(session, qualifier, pipeline=None, is_partner=False)` — partner path: queries `get_qualified_profiles()` directly, ranks, returns top (bypasses READY_TO_CONNECT). Regular path: loops checking `get_ready_candidate()`, then `promote_to_ready()`, then `qualify_one()`/`search_one()` backfill chain. Terminates when a candidate is found or all backfill functions return None.
- **`ml/embeddings.py`** — Fastembed text embedding utilities. Uses `fastembed` (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 by default) for 384-dim embeddings. Functions: `embed_text()`, `embed_texts()`, `embed_profile()` (builds text + embeds + stores via `ProfileEmbedding` model). Storage and querying handled directly by `ProfileEmbedding` Django model.
- **`ml/qualifier.py:BayesianQualifier`** — Pipeline(PCA, StandardScaler, GaussianProcessRegressor) with lazy refit. PCA dimensions selected via LML cross-validation. `update(embedding, label)` appends to training data and invalidates fit. `predict(embedding)` returns `(prob, entropy, posterior_std)` 3-tuple or `None` if unfitted. `predicted_probs(embeddings)` returns probability array. `bald_scores(embeddings)` computes BALD via MC sampling from GP posterior. `rank_profiles(profiles, session, pipeline=None)` sorts by predicted probability (descending); uses `load_embedding()` from `crm_profiles` for lazy embedding loading. `explain(profile, session)` returns human-readable explanation. `warm_start(X, y)` bulk-loads historical labels and fits once. Fitted pipeline persisted via `joblib` to per-campaign path (`model_path_for_campaign()`). Also exports `qualify_with_llm(profile_text, product_docs, campaign_objective)` for LLM-based lead qualification with structured output (`QualificationDecision`).
- **`ml/profile_text.py`** — `build_profile_text()`: concatenates all text fields from profile dict (headline, summary, positions, educations, etc.), lowercased. Used for embedding input.
- **`ml/search_keywords.py`** — `generate_search_keywords(product_docs, campaign_objective, n_keywords=10, exclude_keywords=None)`: calls LLM via `search_keywords.j2` prompt to generate LinkedIn People search queries. `exclude_keywords` prevents regenerating already-used terms.
- **`ml/hub.py`** — Partner campaign hub. `get_kit()` downloads from HuggingFace (`eracle/campaign-kit`), loads `config.json` + `model.joblib`, returns `{"config": dict, "model": sklearn-compatible}` or `None`. `import_partner_campaign(kit_config)` creates/updates a partner `Campaign` with `is_partner=True`. Cached after first attempt.
- **`sessions/account.py:AccountSession`** — Central session object. Loads `LinkedInProfile` from DB, exposes `linkedin_profile`, `campaign` (singular, set by daemon before each lane), `campaigns` (property, all campaigns via group membership), `django_user`, `account_cfg` dict (handle, username, password, subscribe_newsletter, active, cookie_file), and Playwright browser (`page`, `context`, `browser`, `playwright`). Key methods: `ensure_browser()` (launches/recovers browser + login), `wait()` (human delay + page load), `_maybe_refresh_cookies()` (re-login if `li_at` cookie expired), `close()` (graceful teardown). Passed throughout the codebase.
- **`sessions/registry.py:AccountSessionRegistry`** — Singleton registry for `AccountSession` instances. `get_or_create(handle)` normalizes handle (lowercase + strip) and reuses existing sessions. `close_all()` tears down all sessions. Public convenience function: `get_session(handle)` wraps `AccountSessionRegistry.get_or_create()`.
- **`db/crm_profiles.py`** — Profile CRUD backed by DjangoCRM models. Lead-level functions: `lead_exists()`, `create_enriched_lead()`, `disqualify_lead()`, `promote_lead_to_contact()`, `get_leads_for_qualification()` (includes url-only leads), `count_leads_for_qualification()` (includes url-only leads). Lazy helpers: `ensure_lead_enriched(session, lead_id, public_id)` (Voyager API enrichment for url-only leads), `ensure_profile_embedded(lead_id, public_id, session)` (enrichment + fastembed as single lazy operation; enriches url-only leads first), `load_embedding(lead_id, public_id, session)` (loads embedding array, lazily enriching+embedding if needed), `lead_profile_by_id(lead_id)` (parse lead description by PK). Deal-level functions: `set_profile_state()`, `get_qualified_profiles()`, `count_qualified_profiles()`, `get_ready_to_connect_profiles()`, `get_pending_profiles()`, `get_connected_profiles()`, `save_chat_message()`. URL helpers: `url_to_public_id(url)` (strict extractor, path must start with `/in/`), `public_id_to_url(public_id)`. Partner: `seed_partner_deals()`. Private helpers: `_make_ticket()` (uuid4 hex[:16]), `_fetch_profile()` (Voyager API wrapper), `_update_lead_fields()`, `_ensure_company()`, `_attach_raw_data()`. `set_profile_state()` clears `next_step` on actual transitions into/out of PENDING (not same-state). `count_qualified_profiles()` filters `lead__disqualified=False` for non-partner campaigns (consistent with `get_qualified_profiles()`).
- **`gdpr.py`** — GDPR location detection for newsletter auto-subscription. Checks LinkedIn country code against a static set of ISO-2 codes for opt-in email marketing jurisdictions (EU/EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand). Missing/None codes default to protected. `apply_gdpr_newsletter_override()` updates `LinkedInProfile.subscribe_newsletter` in DB for non-GDPR locations.
- **`onboarding.py`** — DB-backed onboarding. `ensure_onboarding()` ensures `LLM_API_KEY` + `AI_MODEL` in `.env`, Campaign in DB, and active LinkedInProfile in DB. If missing, prompts user interactively. Creates Django models directly.
- **`conf.py`** — Loads `LLM_API_KEY` from `.env`. `load_dotenv()` checks `assets/.env` first (Docker volume, persists across recreations), then project root for backwards compat. `ENV_FILE = ASSETS_DIR / ".env"` (writes go to `assets/.env`). Exports `CAMPAIGN_CONFIG` dict (timing and ML defaults as Python constants), `AI_MODEL`, `LLM_API_BASE`, path constants (`PROMPTS_DIR`, `DEFAULT_FOLLOWUP_TEMPLATE_PATH`, `DIAGNOSTICS_DIR`, etc.). `model_path_for_campaign(campaign_id)` returns `MODELS_DIR / f"campaign_{campaign_id}_model.joblib"`. `_LEGACY_MODEL_PATH` (private) points to old global `model.joblib` for migration. `PARTNER_LOG_LEVEL = logging.DEBUG` (suppresses partner campaign messages at normal verbosity). `MIN_DELAY`/`MAX_DELAY` (5/8s) for human-like wait timing. `get_first_active_profile_handle()` queries `LinkedInProfile` model. Creates `COOKIES_DIR`, `DATA_DIR`, `MODELS_DIR`, `DIAGNOSTICS_DIR` on import.
- **`api/voyager.py`** — Parses LinkedIn's Voyager API JSON responses into clean dicts via internal dataclasses (`LinkedInProfile`, `Position`, `Education`). Uses URN reference resolution from the `included` array.
- **`django_settings.py`** — Django settings importing DjangoCRM's default settings. SQLite DB at `assets/data/crm.db`. Key settings: `SECRET_KEY` = hardcoded dev key, `DEBUG = True`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]`, `SITE_ID = 1`, `SITE_TITLE = "OpenOutreach CRM"`, `ADMIN_HEADER = "OpenOutreach Admin"`, `MEDIA_ROOT = DATA_DIR / "media"` (Path, not str), `DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE = "true"`. INSTALLED_APPS includes all DjangoCRM apps + `linkedin`.
- **`admin.py`** — Django Admin registrations: `CampaignAdmin` (list_display: department, booking_link, is_partner, action_fraction), `LinkedInProfileAdmin` (list_display: user, username, active; list_filter: active), `SearchKeywordAdmin` (list_display: keyword, campaign, used, used_at; list_filter: used, campaign), `ActionLogAdmin` (list_display: action_type, linkedin_profile, campaign, created_at; date_hierarchy: created_at; readonly). All use `raw_id_fields` for FK/O2O fields.
- **`management/setup_crm.py`** — Idempotent bootstrap. `setup_crm()` creates Site, "co-workers" Group, Department (`DEPARTMENT_NAME = "LinkedIn Outreach"`). `ensure_campaign_pipeline(dept)` creates 6 stages (Qualified, Ready to Connect, Pending, Connected, Completed, Failed), 2 closing reasons (Completed=success, Failed), and "LinkedIn Scraper" LeadSource. `_check_legacy_stages(dept)` aborts if DB has deals at invalid stages.
- **`templates/renderer.py`** — Two-stage template rendering. `call_llm(prompt)` creates `ChatOpenAI` with `temperature=0.7` and `AI_MODEL`. `render_template(session, template_content, profile)` first renders Jinja2 template (with profile context + `product_description` from `session.campaign.product_docs`), then passes result through `call_llm()`, then appends `booking_link` from campaign (after LLM call, not part of prompt).
- **`navigation/login.py`** — Playwright browser setup and LinkedIn login. `build_playwright()` creates a fresh browser instance. `init_playwright_session(session, handle)` loads saved cookies or performs fresh login. `playwright_login(session)` performs email/password login with human-like typing.
- **`navigation/utils.py`** — Browser navigation utilities. `goto_page(session, action, expected_url_pattern)` navigates and auto-discovers `/in/` URLs via `_extract_in_urls()`. `_enrich_new_urls(session, urls)` auto-enriches discovered profiles (Voyager API + create Lead + embed), rate-limited by `enrich_min_interval` (1s). `human_type(locator, text)` types with random per-keystroke delay (50-200ms). `get_top_card(session)` finds profile card with fallback selectors (`TOP_CARD_SELECTORS`). `first_matching(page, selectors)` returns first visible locator. `save_page(session, profile)` saves HTML to fixtures.
- **`navigation/exceptions.py`** — Custom exceptions: `AuthenticationError`, `TerminalStateError`, `SkipProfile`, `ReachedConnectionLimit`.
- **`actions/connection_status.py`** — `get_connection_status(session, profile) → ProfileState`: fast path via `connection_degree == 1` (trusted), fallback to UI text/button inspection. Text priority: "Pending" → PENDING, "1st"/"1st degree" → CONNECTED, "Connect" button → QUALIFIED. Has CLI `__main__` block.
- **`actions/connect.py`** — `send_connection_request(session, profile) → ProfileState`: tries `_connect_direct()` (top card button), falls back to `_connect_via_more()` (More menu). Sends WITHOUT a note. `_check_weekly_invitation_limit(session)` raises `ReachedConnectionLimit` on limit popup. Has CLI `__main__` block.
- **`actions/message.py`** — `send_follow_up_message(session, profile) → str | None`: checks connection status first, renders template via `render_template()`, sends via popup (`_send_msg_pop_up`) or direct messaging thread (`_send_message`). Returns message text or None. Has CLI `__main__` block.
- **`actions/profile.py`** — `scrape_profile(session, profile) → (profile_dict, raw_data)`: calls Voyager API via `PlaywrightLinkedinAPI`. Has CLI `__main__` block with `--save-fixture` flag.
- **`actions/search.py`** — `search_profile(session, profile)`: direct URL navigation (no human search simulation). `search_people(session, keyword, page=1)`: LinkedIn People search with pagination. Auto-discovery via `goto_page()`. Has CLI `__main__` block.

### Configuration
- **`.env`** — `LLM_API_KEY` (required), `AI_MODEL` (required). Optionally `LLM_API_BASE`. All prompted during onboarding if missing.

  - `qualification_n_mc_samples` (100)
  - `min_ready_to_connect_prob` (0.9) — GP probability threshold for promoting QUALIFIED profiles to READY_TO_CONNECT
  - `embedding_model` ("BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"), `min_qualifiable_leads` (50)
- **Campaign model** — `product_docs`, `campaign_objective`, `followup_template`, `booking_link` — managed via Django Admin or onboarding.
- **LinkedInProfile model** — `linkedin_username`, `linkedin_password`, `subscribe_newsletter`, `active`, `connect_daily_limit` (20), `connect_weekly_limit` (100), `follow_up_daily_limit` (30) — managed via Django Admin or onboarding.
- **`assets/templates/prompts/qualify_lead.j2`** — LLM-based lead qualification. Receives `product_docs`, `campaign_objective`, `profile_text`. Structured output: `QualificationDecision(qualified: bool, reason: str)`. LLM temperature: **0.7**, timeout: 60s.
- **`assets/templates/prompts/search_keywords.j2`** — LLM-based search keyword generation. Receives `product_docs`, `campaign_objective`, `n_keywords`, `exclude_keywords`. Structured output: `SearchKeywords(keywords: list[str])`. LLM temperature: **0.9** (high diversity).

### Error Handling Convention
The application should crash on unexpected errors. `try/except` blocks should only handle expected, recoverable errors. Custom exceptions in `navigation/exceptions.py`: `AuthenticationError`, `TerminalStateError`, `SkipProfile`, `ReachedConnectionLimit`.

### Docker
- **Base image:** `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.55.0-noble` (includes browsers + system deps).
- **VNC access:** Xvfb (virtual display) + x11vnc on port 5900 for remote viewing.
- **Build arg:** `BUILD_ENV` (default: production) selects requirements file.
- **Install order:** uv pip → DjangoCRM via `--no-deps` → requirements → Playwright chromium.
- **Startup:** `/start` script (CRLF normalized with sed).

### CI/CD
- **`.github/workflows/tests.yml`** — Runs pytest (in Docker) on push to `master` and PRs.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** — On push to `master` or version tags (`v*`): runs tests, then builds and pushes the production Docker image to `ghcr.io/eracle/openoutreach`. Tags: `latest`, `sha-<commit>`, semver (`v1.0.0` → `1.0.0` + `1.0`).

### Dependencies
Managed via `requirements/` files. DjangoCRM's `mysqlclient` is excluded via `--no-deps` in the install step. `uv pip install` is used for fast installs (both locally via `make setup` and in Docker).

Core: `playwright`, `playwright-stealth`, `Django`, `django-crm-admin`, `pandas`, `langchain`/`langchain-openai`, `jinja2`, `pydantic`, `jsonpath-ng`, `tendo`, `termcolor`
ML/Embeddings: `scikit-learn` (GaussianProcessRegressor), `numpy`, `fastembed`, `joblib`
